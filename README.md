### Hi there, I'm Tom ðŸ‘‹

My pronouns are he/him, I'm 15 and from the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. I'm currently enrolled in Secondary School studying, among other subjects, Computer Science. Recently, I've been working on a project called ARWIN, a system to control my life and the devices around me, and also to host my personal website and portfolio. At the same time, I'm working on projects to build my portfolio for future careers and opportunities.

I am familiar with Python, with 2 years experience, a little Swift, and HTML and CSS. I am looking to expand to JavaScript soon, Java, C, C# and C++ in the future. Not too sure yet as I'm still figuring things out.
